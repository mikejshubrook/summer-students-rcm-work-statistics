# Quantum work statistics with the reaction coordinate mapping

This is a repository to document the work that I am doing supervising two undergraduate students at the University of Manchester in the summer between their 3rd and 4th years.

## Project Overview

This is a project based on work done during my PhD thesis. I did not get enough results during this project to publish a paper, and have been busy working on another project since handing in my thesis. 

The project uses a generalised quantum master equation in order to calculate work statistics and photon number statistics for a periodically driven two level quantum system interacting with a phonon bath and the electromagnetic field. It relies on the reaction coordinate master equation, and includes interesting effects due to the non-additivity of the two environments coupled to the open quantum system.

I thought it would be a great introductory project for some undergraduates to take on. My plan is to walk them through the derivation of the generalised reaction coordinate master equation, and have them rederive it themselves. Then, we will code it up, using good programming practices (much better than those I used during my PhD).

My hope is that this will be a beneficial project for the students and myself. They will hopefully learn a lot, and I will solidify my understanding of the work even more by teaching it to people.
